### What is Hackclub Shiba?

Hack club is a non-profit organization that helps high school students get excited about coding! The top 30 games in Hackclub Shiba get to go to Tokyo, Japan and make a arcade with the games they made! (soo cool!)

Shiba is a game jam where you iterate on a game over some number of weeks (or multiple games), get feedback on how to improve it, and then at the end build an in-person Arcade in Tokyo with other kind Hack Clubbers!
Whether or not you earn your ticket to come, Shiba is an opportunity to become a game developer alongside other teens. 

# What is Change of Nature?

Change of Nature is a 'kinda' horror game created in Godot 4.4.1. The player will traverse though room after room, facing unexplainable phenomena. Be careful! As right when you think you have something figured out, it might ***change its nature!!*** (omg name drop!!)
